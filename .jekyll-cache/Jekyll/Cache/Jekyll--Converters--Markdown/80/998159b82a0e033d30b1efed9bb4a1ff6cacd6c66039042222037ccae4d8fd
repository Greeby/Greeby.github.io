<p>Hello! My name is Will and welcome to my projects blog. I am currently a student at the University of Colorado, Boulder studying electrical/computer engineering. I created this website in order 
to push my studies and projects to the next level by forcing myself to document the process. The main idea is to get a solid sense of how far I have progressed with the projects I am working on and the topics
that I am learning. The things I am mainly concerned with working on are, you probably guessed, electronics/computer related projects with a digital focus. Along with these projects I will be also talking about what I am
learning in terms of skills inside and outside of my education. I really want to create a place that I can go back and look
at what I have learned as reference and reassurance when inevitable ‚ÄúImposter Syndrome‚Äù kicks in.
That being said, lets get right into the meat of it.</p>

<h2 id="baseline-knowledge">Baseline Knowledge</h2>
<p>As of June 2021, this is a short summary of my skills.</p>
<ul>
  <li>C/C++</li>
  <li>x86 assembly</li>
  <li>Basic microcontroller knowledge</li>
  <li>Verilog</li>
  <li>GTKwave and simulation techniques</li>
  <li>Basic circuits knowledge</li>
  <li>Filter circuit knowledge</li>
  <li>Simple circuit debugging</li>
  <li>Math through (Calculus III and Differential Equations)</li>
  <li>Intro physics Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism</li>
  <li>Basic matlab</li>
  <li>git</li>
  <li>Virtual machine knowledge</li>
  <li>Basic computer hardware knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first-plans">First Plans</h2>
<p>I am starting out by killing a couple of birds in one stone. I want to accomplish two things first. One, I want to switch
from a Windows environment and learn linux. Two, I want to get back into FGPGA development. I will go in depth on my 
plans and topics I want to get familiar with for each, but that is the start, I guess.</p>

<h3 id="intro-and-machine-specs">Intro and Machine Specs</h3>
<p>I have been thinking about doing this for a while now. I have always looked at linux as something really interesting
and it intimidated me because of how technical it can look from the outside. I used this website as an opportunity 
to finally make the switch. I am not fully commited to Linux in the sense that I erased windows and just started a new. 
I am currently running a virtual machine using Virtual Box. I have given the machine 8 cores of my 16 and 8Gb of RAM. 
With these specs, this machine should be pretty snappy.</p>

<h3 id="distribution">Distribution</h3>
<p>I chose to use Pop!_OS for this machine because I am looking to purchase a System76 laptop.
System76 is the developer of Pop!_OS as well as a laptop manufacturer. 
I will talk about that in another post though. This distribution seemed cool to me, because
since it is based on Ubuntu, finding help online is plentiful and it is good for new Linux users.
Also I have seen the distribution feaatured on a lot of Linus Media Group videos on youtube. They seemed to like
it so I have been using it heavily for around the past week.</p>
