<p>Hello! My name is Will and welcome to my projects blog. I am currently a student at the University of Colorado, Boulder studying electrical/computer engineering. I created this website in order 
to push my studies and projects to the next level by forcing myself to document the process. The main idea is to get a solid sense of how far I have progressed with the projects I am working on and the topics
that I am learning. The things I am mainly concerned with working on are, you probably guessed, electronics/computer related projects with a digital focus. Along with these projects I will be also talking about what I am
learning in terms of skills inside and outside of my education. I really want to create a place that I can go back and look
at what I have learned as reference and reassurance when inevitable ‚ÄúImposter Syndrome‚Äù kicks in.
That being said, lets get right into the meat of it.</p>

<h3 id="baseline-knowledge">Baseline Knowledge</h3>
<ul>
  <li>C/C++</li>
  <li>x86 Assembly</li>
  <li>Verilog</li>
  <li>GTKwave and Simulation Techniques</li>
  <li>Basic Circuits Knowledge</li>
  <li>Filter Circuit Knowledge</li>
  <li>Math through (Calculus III and Differential Equations)</li>

<h3 id="first-plans">First Plans</h3>
<p>I am starting out by killing a couple of birds in one stone. I want to accomplish two things first. One, I want to switch
from a Windows environment and learn linux. Two, I want to get back into FGPGA development. I will go in depth on my 
plans and topics I want to get familiar with for each.</p>
